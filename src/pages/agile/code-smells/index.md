A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system. 
  -Martin Fowler

It's a hunch, something that you can tell at a glance that all might not be right with code you are reading.  If it is indeed a deeper problem in the system, then it should be fixed through refactoring.  Not all code smells are worth fixing (refactoring).

Some examples of code smell:
Long Methods - If methods are too long, then they should be broken up into smaller methods.
Data Clumps - If multiple methods take the same parameters, then it is an indication that they should maybe be clumped together into a class.
Duplicated code - If you see duplication of code try and get rid of it.  Keep code DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself).
